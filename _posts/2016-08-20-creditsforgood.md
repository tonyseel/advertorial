The information provided has saved many people a lot of money. These are few important tricks of the trade used by various credit repair businesses.

> Ted Rood, a senior loan officer in St. Louis, says he has seen credit scores jump as much as 100 points as a result of this approach.

He says, by knowing, understanding and utilizing your legal rights you can begin taking the steps of regain the good credit you once had and reward yourself with the confidence necessary to rebuild your financial independence and freedom. Of course you must protect your new credit report with honesty, integrity, and common sense.

*The truth is that your creditors and the credit bureaus have been swapping information about you behind your back for a long time.*

The system, as it stands today, does not give you the opportunity to defend yourself before inscribing your credit file with negative information, even if it is not yours! You must prove to them that the negative information on your credit file is incorrect, invalid or otherwise erroneous before they will remove it. That means in their eyes, you are GUILTY until proven INNOCENT.

> “Words cannot express how happy I am with John. I had 14 items between all 3 credit bureaus and within the first 30 days he has gotten 8 items deleted from my credit report. He is an amazing person and I thank them he just don't know what he has done to my life. Thank you so much John”

Your creditors pay to see your credit file information and believe it to be true and correct. They also reciprocate by exchanging your credit information with the credit bureaus. So... your creditors pay the credit bureaus and the credit bureaus are in business to make a profit. Where do you fit in? You don't.

Unfortunately you are just another number in the vast data bank of numbers. Your credit report and the information it contains are not important or of any consequence to anyone but you. That's why you are the only one that can do anything about it. 

**Well my friend, that's why I put this information together and developed this unique program. I have seen too many people destroyed by the credit reporting system. I have watched helplessly by the wayside as their credit files were corrupted and their self dignity was destroyed in the process.**

So many people with poor credit have done their best to make timely payments but couldn't because of a personal problem or another. Should they pay for this both financially and emotionally for the next seven to ten years? I don't believe so. I believe everyone deserves a second chance. I believe that you deserve a second chance, no matter what the previous circumstances were. 

Put those problems behind you now. It's time to move on and re-establish a good credit file.

I am also offering a paid credit repair service where you only pay for deletion. You can start seeing the results within the first 30 days.
