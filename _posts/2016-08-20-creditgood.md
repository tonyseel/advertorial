Bad credit can be very stressful. It often throws people into a tailspin, but there is hope. It is hard to pay old debt when new debt is steadily accumulating. So what do you do?

There is a strategy that can be applied. There truly is a method to the madness! Really...

The first thing you want to do is set up an account online with creditkarma.com. This service actually allows you to check your credit whenever you want without affecting your credit score. It also allows you to dispute discrepancies online.

After this is done, you want to contact all of your creditors to negotiate a payment for delete relationship. You want as many creditors as possible to agree to delete the item from your credit report if you make a payment. You want to try to negotiate a payment that is less than the full amount but if that is not possible then an agreement to delete for payment in full will suffice.
